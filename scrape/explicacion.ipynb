    "#### Important Jargon:\n",
    "- A **contract factory** is  a smart contract that is designed to create other smart contracts. It acts as a template or a blueprint for creating multiple instances of similar smart contracts. \n",
    "- **Internal Txns** are also called \"internal transactions\" and it refer to transactions that occur within the internal state of the blockchain network. \n",
    "- **Application Binary Interface ( ABI ) of a verified smart contract** is a standardized interface between smart contracts and the applications or users that interact with them. It defines the methods that a smart contract exposes to the external world, including the input parameters and return values for each method. (It seems that some contracts show it and other don't depending if the person who verified the contract uploaded it) (PERHAPS ENDPOINT MAY BE USEFUL)\n",
    "- (To check what can we do with it) a **Proxy Contract** is a design pattern that allows for upgradability and flexibility in decentralized applications (DApps) without changing the contract's address on the blockchain. This pattern is particularly useful in situations where smart contracts need to be modified or upgraded after deployment without disrupting the existing users or applications that interact with the contract.\n",
    "- https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/backend/#available-libraries has many interesting backend utilities\n",
